## What
projectjs is a starting template for web applications that require user projects. 
A project can be anything, if yours is saved as a string, you can start right away.
A login screen and projects overview is already implemented.

## Why
I figured that many services are centered around the idea of user projects, but I 
couldn't find a template to start with. So I made one myself!

## How
The project is currently written in Express with Mongoose as the DB driver and PassportJS 
as login manager. Install all dependencies with `node install`. Add your configuration in a 
dotenv file and run `node server` to run the application. A configuration template is 
provided in [example-dotenv](example-dotenv)

## To-Do
- Add other log in options
- Add other databases (FaunaDB, Firestore, SQL, etc.)
- Add other token options (JWT)
- Add group/organization schema
- Simplify: Remove dependencies

please [write me an emailðŸ“§](mailto:redpandadevs@gmail.com), so I can link your project here

## Technical Details
Note: I am currently working on a version that uses Bootstrap 5 and TypeORM to reduce complexity and increase modularity
